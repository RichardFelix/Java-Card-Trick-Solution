# Java-Card-Trick-Solution

This is a card trick my Math teacher gave us to figure out in code.  This is how the trick works.	
1. Get any number of cards in the same suit.	
2. Use algorithm to put cards in correct order.	  
3  Flip first card and stack face up on table.
4. Take next card and do not flip over and put on the bottom of the deck.
5. Repeate steps 3 and 4 till all cards are on table face up in order.
6. Enjoy.
