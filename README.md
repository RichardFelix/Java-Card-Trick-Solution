# Java-Card-Trick-Solution

This is a card trick my Math teacher gave us to figure out in code.  This is how the trick works.	
1. Get any number of cards in the same suit.	
2. Use algorithm to put cards in correct order.	
3. Flip one card to show the face of the card and put on table in a stack.	
4. Take next card and do not show face of the card and put on a seperate stack.	
5. Repeat till all cards are in two stacks.	
6. Now take the unexposed card stack and repeat steps 3 - 6. Till all cards are shown on flipped stack in order.	
7. Enjoy
